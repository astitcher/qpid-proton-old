/**
 * An event provides notification of a state change within the
 * protocol engine's object model.
 *
 * The AMQP endpoint state modeled by the protocol engine is captured
 * by the following object types: @link pn_delivery_t Deliveries
 * @endlink, @link pn_link_t Links @endlink, @link pn_session_t
 * Sessions @endlink, @link pn_connection_t Connections @endlink, and
 * @link pn_transport_t Transports @endlink. These objects are related
 * as follows:
 *
 * - @link pn_delivery_t Deliveries @endlink always have a single
 *   parent Link
 * - @link pn_link_t Links @endlink always have a single parent
 *   Session
 * - @link pn_session_t Sessions @endlink always have a single parent
 *   Connection
 * - @link pn_connection_t Connections @endlink optionally have at
 *   most one associated Transport
 * - @link pn_transport_t Transports @endlink optionally have at most
 *   one associated Connection
 *
 * Every event has a type (see ::pn_event_type_t) that identifies what
 * sort of state change has occurred along with a pointer to the
 * object whose state has changed (as well as its associated objects).
 *
 * Events are accessed by creating a @link pn_collector_t Collector
 * @endlink with ::pn_collector() and registering it with the @link
 * pn_connection_t Connection @endlink of interest through use of
 * ::pn_connection_collect(). Once a collector has been registered,
 * ::pn_collector_peek() and ::pn_collector_pop() are used to access
 * and process events.
