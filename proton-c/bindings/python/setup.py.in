first install version @PN_VERSION@ of the Proton development library
(libqpid-proton) and its C header files. These files must be available in order
to build this packages' C-based extension.

Packages for the Proton development library may be provided by your system's
distribution. For example, the qpid-proton-c-devel RPM is available for
Centos/RHEL via EPEL.  A libqpid-proton2-dev deb file is available for Ubuntu
via the Apache Qpid PPA (ppa:qpid/released).

If your distribution does not make these packages available, you can download
the Proton sources directly from the Apache Qpid project:

 http://qpid.apache.org

This package is compatible with the @PN_VERSION@ release of the Proton
development library.

If you need additional help, see http://qpid.apache.org/discussion.html
